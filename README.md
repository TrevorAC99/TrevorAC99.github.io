# Making Changes
## HTML
Changes to html require no additional work beyond modified the appropriate
files.

## CSS
To make changes to the styling, edit the desired css file(s) and then run
bundlecss (either the .bat or the .sh depending on your platform). This will
generate the cssmin/bundle.css file. This currently uses the api provided by
https://cssminifier.com/ though this should probably be changed in the future
in case the website ever goes down.
