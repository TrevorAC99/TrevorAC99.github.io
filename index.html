            <h5>Here's a bit more detail...</h5>
            <p>
              My software development journey began at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, and I fell in love
              immediately. I thoroughly enjoyed my classes, but the most valuable part of my undergrad years was the
              student job I began during the first semester of my sophomore year as a software developer working on the
              university's student portal website and a few other web applications. That job gave me a head start
              working with large production systems using industry standard technologies while still in school. During
              my time at the university, I worked my way up to becoming a team lead, which provided even more useful
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the summer between my junior and senior years, I interned at Epic Systems Corporation. After
              graduation, I took a full time position there working on the Tapestry product, Epic's solution for large
              scale managed care organizations. At Epic I worked in a full stack capacity using various technologies
              including MUMPS on the database, C# web servers, React on the front end, and Visual Basic 6 with some of
              the older components. Most of my work involved the generation and exporting of various files including
              PDFs, CSVs, and health insurance claim files in the ANSI X12 837 format.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a few years on site at Epic, I went looking for a remote position and joined BAM Technologies where
              I work today. I work as a full stack developer on MyVector, the United States Air Force's enterprise
              solution for personnel development, training, assignments, and more. At BAM I work in an Agile environment
              on a heavily distributed system using C#/ASP.NET microservices with REST and GraphQL endpoints, PostgreSQL
              databases, Angular front ends, and AWS for technologies such as message queues, DynamoDB, and OpenSearch.
              I've been a driver in the adoption of GraphQL adoption. I've also developed a few internal tools for things
              like automating the process of creating local clones of our development postgres databases and quickly
              generating JWTs for testing purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work, I'm very interested in systems software such as operating systems, file systems, and
              compilers. I'm especially fond of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">the Rust programming language</a>,
              which I use for most of my personal projects. I've recently started exploring AArch64 assembly and have
              had a lot of fun writing programs purely in assembly. I'm also exploring mobile development with Kotlin
              and Swift. I've grown to love the way that Kotlin allows you to express logic and create what amount to
              DSLs within itself.
